# 🌌 Lunar Terrain Reconstruction & Visualization System

This project transforms grayscale 2D images of the lunar surface into detailed, interactive 3D terrain models. Designed for mission planners, scientists, and space agencies, the system supports hazard analysis, rover path planning, and safe landing zone identification.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This AI-based tool uses techniques like Shape-from-Shading and Gradient Domain Reconstruction to extract elevation data from 2D images. It visualizes the terrain in 3D with slope and hazard overlays, providing critical insights for lunar exploration missions.

> Internally named **ISRO HAVK**, the project simulates real-world terrain intelligence capabilities for space operations.
