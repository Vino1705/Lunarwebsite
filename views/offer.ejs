  <h2>Our Offerings: Advanced Lunar Terrain Intelligence</h2>

  <div class="offer-section">

    <p>
      Our core offering is a powerful <strong>Lunar Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Generation and Visualization System</strong>.
      This platform transforms standard 2D lunar images into highly accurate and interactive 3D terrain models. It empowers
      <em>mission planners, engineers, and astronauts</em> with critical topographical insights for improved decision-making,
      operational safety, and mission success.
    </p>

    <h3>🌌 Accurate 3D Terrain Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>We convert flat grayscale lunar imagery into dynamic 3D terrain meshes, capturing surface undulations and elevation variations with precision.</p>

    <h3>⚠️ Slope & Hazard Analysis</h3>
    <p>Our system produces detailed slope maps and intuitive <strong>Red-Yellow-Green hazard maps</strong> for identifying safe, moderate-risk, and high-risk regions.</p>

    <h3>🧭 Intelligent Path Planning</h3>
    <p>We compute optimal rover/astronaut routes using slope-aware pathfinding algorithms, allowing user-defined slope thresholds.</p>

    <h3>🛰️ Interactive 3D Exploration</h3>
    <p>Explore the terrain in an immersive WebGL 3D viewer with overlay toggles for <em>normal view, slope map, and hazard map</em>.</p>

    <h3>📌 Precision Tooltips</h3>
    <p>Hover anywhere on the model to get <strong>real-time X, Y, Z coordinates</strong>, slope angle, and local hazard level.</p>

    <h3>📊 Advanced Terrain Analytics</h3>
    <p>Gain statistical insights including <strong>elevation range, slope distribution, top 5 extreme points</strong>, and more.</p>

    <h3>📏 Operational Tools</h3>
    <p>Use the measurement tool to calculate <strong>distance and average slope</strong> between any two selected terrain points.</p>

    <h3>🚀 Auto Landing Zone Detection</h3>
    <p>Automatically detects and highlights <strong>safe landing or base setup zones</strong> based on terrain safety analysis.</p>

    <h3>🧑‍🚀 User-Centric Interface</h3>
    <p>Enjoy a seamless experience with <strong>drag-and-drop uploads</strong>, live image previews, preprocessing toggles, and a futuristic space-themed design.</p>

    <h3>📥 Data Export Support</h3>
    <p>Download the <strong>3D mesh (.obj)</strong>, <strong>hazard/slope maps (.png)</strong>, or <strong>raw elevation data (.npy)</strong> for future analysis.</p>

    <h3>🔮 Future Capabilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>AI-based safe landing zone prediction</li>
      <li>Rover path simulation and dynamic terrain traversal</li>
      <li>Live integration with ISRO/NASA mission datasets</li>
    </ul>
